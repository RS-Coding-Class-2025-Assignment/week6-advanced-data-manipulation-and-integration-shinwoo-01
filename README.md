# Coding Class â€“ This Semester

Welcome to our advanced coding class, where we continue building on concepts from previous semesters and dive deeper into application development, spatial/image analysis, and robust software practices.

## Course Overview
This semester, we will:
1. **Apply Advanced Python Techniques**  
   Build well-structured applications using best coding practices. We will refactor and improve codebases to maximize readability, maintainability, and scalability.

2. **Leverage Hyperspectral Processing Methods**  
   Incorporate and extend the hyperspectral data processing techniques learned last semester, ensuring familiarity with image handling, data transformations, and relevant libraries.

3. **Design User-Friendly Interfaces (CLI or GUI)**  
   Focus on creating intuitive command-line interfaces (CLI) and/or graphical user interfaces (GUI) that enhance user experience and streamline workflows.

4. **Perform Spatial Analyses & Image Classification**  
   Conduct both basic and advanced spatial analyses to interpret geospatial data. Implement image classification techniques for a variety of tasks, including remote sensing applications.

5. **Design & Implement Machine Learning Models**  
   Develop machine learning solutions tailored to image processing tasks, including feature extraction, classification, and predictive modeling with Python-based libraries.

6. **Implement Robust Testing & Debugging Practices**  
   Write thorough unit, integration, and system tests to ensure code reliability. Employ debugging strategies to identify and resolve issues quickly and effectively.

7. **Optimize Performance & Document Software**  
   Use profiling tools and optimization methods to enhance application performance. Maintain detailed documentation for all modules, ensuring clarity for future development and collaboration.

## What You Will Learn
- Advanced Python development patterns and best practices.
- Practical hyperspectral processing in real-world scenarios.
- Effective user interface design for command-line and graphical applications.
- Spatial data analysis, image classification workflows, and geospatial data handling.
